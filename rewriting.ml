 * The mark and sweep

 * TODO: be better than that ... because gates other than fork and join

 *
 * CORRECT BEHAVIOR
 *
 *  for each reachable node, 
 *      for each edge going to a non-reachable node
 *      replace it with Disconnect
 *
 *      for each edge coming from a non-reachable node
 *      replace it with Bottom

 *   This function should replace Â« update_forks_and_joins Â»

 * NOTE the second part is not necessary because of the
